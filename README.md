# Logo_Generator

## Description
I created this project to get some practice on a few things, those being node.js, jest testing, and a further understanding  of class creation. This project solves the task of having to pay a graphic designer as it generates an industry standard logo that will rival that of your competitors


## Installation
This is a command line application, therefore to access this application you would have to clone this repo and either open it in gitbash or vs code's terminal 

Alternatively you can watch my walkthrough at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bt7uKgzIzM
## Usage
Once you have got the repo open in your terminal, type "node index.js" to start. From there all you must do is answer the prompts provided and the generator will do all the work!
